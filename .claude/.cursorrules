# Admin CMS Context Rules

- Framework: Next.js (TypeScript, App Router).
- State: Use React hooks and Next.js server components where appropriate.
- Database: Prisma with Supabase Postgres.
- Auth: NextAuth with Google OAuth, Supabase service role for admin tasks.
- API: Use Next.js API routes under `/app/api`.
- Styling: TailwindCSS only. No inline styles.
- File structure:
  - `app/` for routes and layouts
  - `components/` for UI
  - `lib/` for helpers and config

# Quoting Rules
- Always use **single quotes `'`** for imports, strings, and JSX props.
- Only use `&quot;` when writing raw HTML inside JSX (e.g. `<p title=&quot;example&quot;>`).
- For TypeScript/JavaScript strings, use `'` to avoid escape issues.
- Never output double quotes `"` inside double-quoted JSX attributes — switch to single quotes instead.

# Boundaries
- Do not mix logic for the public-facing website into this repo.
- Do not generate Vite code here — this project is strictly Next.js.

# Shared Conventions
- Always generate TypeScript, not JavaScript.
- Favor clean, modular, and scalable code.
- Prioritize accessibility and mobile responsiveness.
- Keep responses concise — prefer annotated code snippets with explanations.
