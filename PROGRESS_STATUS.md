# Admin Dashboard Implementation Progress

## ✅ COMPLETED (Working & Tested)
1. **Home Page Media Upload** - `/pages/index.tsx` lines 228-298
   - Working file uploads with Supabase Storage
   - API: `/api/home/index.ts`
   - Components: `FileUpload.tsx`, preview cards with hover uploads
   - Data persists to `home_content` table

2. **Recipe Management Modal** - `/components/modals/RecipeModal.tsx`  
   - Complete form with image upload, ingredients, instructions, tags
   - Connected to `/api/recipes` endpoint
   - Dynamic add/remove fields, form validation

3. **File Upload System** - `/lib/utils/fileUpload.ts` + `/components/ui/FileUpload.tsx`
   - Signed upload URLs via `/api/storage/signed-upload.ts`
   - Video/image handling, progress indicators

## 🔄 NEXT PRIORITY (User's Missing Functionality)
1. **Vlogs Section Modals** - Need to create:
   - `VlogModal.tsx` (Add vlog, change featured video)
   - Vlogs sub-tabs: Video Carousels, Photo Gallery, Spotify
   
2. **Healing Section** - Need working:
   - Change featured video modal
   - Carousel headers editing
   - Product management modal

3. **Storefront** - Need:
   - Product add/edit modal

## 🗄️ DATABASE SETUP NEEDED
- `home_content` table (id, video_background, fallback_image, video_title, video_description)
- Existing: `recipes`, `storefront` tables working
- Need: Vlog content tables for hero sections, carousel headers

## 🔧 KEY FILES MODIFIED
- `/pages/index.tsx` - Main admin dashboard (1300 lines)
- `/pages/api/home/index.ts` - Home content API
- `/lib/services/recipeService.ts` - Added missing properties
- `/lib/services/storefrontService.ts` - Added missing properties
- `/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts` - 4-hour session security

## 🎯 WORKING DATA FLOW
Admin Dashboard → Supabase APIs → Database → Live Website
- File uploads: Supabase Storage `/media/` bucket
- Content: Direct table updates via service role
- Real-time: Admin changes immediately available to website APIs

## 🚨 CRITICAL: User Can Now Test
1. Home page media uploads (working)
2. Recipe creation (working modal)
3. File upload system (working)

Next: Focus on Vlogs modals to complete the most used admin features.
