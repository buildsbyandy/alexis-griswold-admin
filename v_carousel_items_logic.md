We brought in **`v_carousel_items`** during the refactor. Here’s what that accomplished:

---

### 1. **Unified View Layer**

* Instead of querying raw `carousels` + `carousel_items` separately on every page, we created a **database view** called `v_carousel_items`.
* That view **joins `carousels` with `carousel_items`**, so each row already knows:

  * which page it belongs to (`page`)
  * which carousel slug it’s part of (`slug`)
  * and the item’s details (`kind`, `youtube_id`, `image_path`, `caption`, `order_index`, etc.).

This reduced query boilerplate — no more `.eq('carousel_id', …).order('video_order')` in every service.

---

### 2. **Consistent Service Queries**

* On the **public Vite repo**, every page’s service now just calls:

  ```ts
  supabase
    .from('v_carousel_items')
    .select('*')
    .eq('page', 'recipes')
    .eq('slug', 'hero-reels')
    .order('order_index', { ascending: true })
  ```

* No need to join or remember which table was called `video_carousels` vs `carousel_videos` vs `recipe_hero_videos`.

Result: **one consistent query pattern across Vlogs, Recipes, Healing, and Storefront**.

---

### 3. **Cleaner TypeScript Types**

* Because `v_carousel_items` is in `supabase.generated.ts`, the generated type already includes both carousel metadata and item fields.
* That means services can strongly type the returned data without juggling multiple interfaces.
* It also eliminated issues where AI/code expected `video_order` but got `order_index`.

---

### 4. **Future-Proofing**

* By using a view, we insulated the frontend from schema churn.

  * If later you add `badge` or `link_url` to `carousel_items`, the view automatically surfaces it.
  * If you reorganize how `carousels` are stored, the frontend query doesn’t need to change.

This made both repos (public + admin CMS) more resilient to Supabase schema changes.

---

✅ **In short:**
`v_carousel_items` was created to **simplify querying** by combining carousel metadata + items into a single, easy-to-consume dataset. It eliminated the need for page-specific carousel tables and reduced TypeScript mismatches, while future-proofing the app.
