Now I have a complete understanding of the issue. Let me complete the analysis and provide the solution.

● Root Cause Analysis

  I've identified the root cause of your data flow disconnect:

  The Problem: Mixed Data Sources

  Your public site is using static fallback data instead of live Supabase data:

  1. Home.tsx (line 72-86): Falls back to static homePageData when Supabase fails
  2. Recipes.tsx: Uses hardcoded recipesData instead of Supabase
  3. Vlogs.tsx: Uses static vlogService instead of Supabase

  Why No API Activity in Logs

  The public site only tries Supabase once in Home.tsx:24-28, but:
  - If it gets any error (including RLS permission denied), it silently falls back to static data
  - Recipes and Vlogs pages don't even attempt Supabase calls
  - Zero network activity = no logs

  Data Flow Issues Identified

  1. Public Site Data Fetching

  - Home: Uses direct Supabase client calls with React Query
  - Recipes: Uses static data from recipesData.ts
  - Vlogs: Uses static data from vlogService.ts
  - Result: Only Home page attempts database access

  2. RLS Policy Problem

  Your public site uses VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY but the tables were likely created by your admin using SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY. RLS 
  policies probably don't allow anonymous access to read the data.

  3. Environment Configuration

  - Vite config correctly handles VITE_ prefixed variables
  - Supabase client properly uses environment variables
  - Admin saves with service role key, public reads with anon key

  Recommended Solution

  Option 1: Fix RLS Policies (Recommended)

  Add RLS policies to allow anonymous read access:

  -- Enable RLS if not already enabled
  ALTER TABLE home_content ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  ALTER TABLE navigation_buttons ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  ALTER TABLE recipes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  ALTER TABLE vlogs_page_content ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  -- ... other tables

  -- Allow anonymous read access
  CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access" ON home_content
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

  CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access" ON navigation_buttons
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

  CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access" ON recipes
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

  -- Repeat for all content tables...

  Option 2: Update Public Site Data Fetching

  Modify components to use Supabase services instead of static data:

  recipes.tsx should use SupabaseRecipeService
  vlogs.tsx should use SupabaseVlogsService

  Immediate Fix

  Check your Supabase dashboard → Authentication → Policies to see if your tables have public read policies. That's likely the missing
  piece causing the disconnect.

  The admin saves successfully because it uses the service role key (bypasses RLS), but the public site can't read because anonymous users     
  don't have permission.
